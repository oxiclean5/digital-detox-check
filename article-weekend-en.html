            <p>Weekends are precious for recharging. But have you ever found yourself wasting time just looking at your smartphone? How about taking a break from your smartphone this weekend and enjoying 'real rest'? Here are 7 practical tips you can start using right away.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Start Your Morning with an 'Analog Alarm'</h2>
                <p>The habit of turning off your smartphone alarm and checking notifications that came overnight is where it all begins. Try using a cheap alarm clock instead. Starting your morning peacefully without your smartphone for the first 10 minutes can change your whole day.</p>

                <h2>2. Announce Your 'No Contact Time' in Advance</h2>
                <p>Let family or friends who might worry know in advance, "I won't be checking my phone on Saturday afternoon!" This way, you can enjoy your detox without psychological pressure.</p>

                <h2>3. Analog Travel? Use a 'Paper Map'!</h2>
                <p>Take a short walk to a nearby neighborhood or park. Instead of your smartphone map, try using a paper map from a tourist information center, or just wander wherever your feet take you. You'll be surprised how much more you notice your surroundings.</p>

                <h2>4. Immerse Yourself in a Hands-On Hobby</h2>
                <p>Catch up on that book you've been meaning to read, try drawing, cooking, knitting, or watering plants â€“ focus on activities that involve your hands. Engaging your hands activates your brain and naturally makes you forget about wanting to use your smartphone.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Enjoy 'Music' Without Your Smartphone</h2>
                <p>Instead of smartphone streaming apps, try listening to music on an old MP3 player or radio. You might discover unexpected good songs, and there's no risk of being tempted by other apps.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Befriend 'Boredom'</h2>
                <p>The reason we grab our smartphones at every spare moment is often because we can't stand boredom. This weekend, give yourself the 'right to be bored' by simply staring out the window or mindlessly sipping tea. Your brain can rest, and creative thoughts might emerge.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>7. End Your Day with a 'Journal Entry'</h2>
                <p>Before bed, instead of your smartphone, open a notebook and jot down your feelings or thoughts from the day. You'll realize how enriching a day disconnected from the digital world can be, and it will also help you sleep soundly.</p>
