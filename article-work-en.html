            <p>While digital devices can boost our work efficiency, they can also be the biggest distraction. Here are some smart digital habits to maximize your work focus.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Actively Use 'Do Not Disturb' Mode</h2>
                <p>When you need to concentrate on work, turn on your smartphone's 'Do Not Disturb' mode. By blocking all notifications and only allowing essential calls, you can minimize unnecessary interruptions. Setting it to automatically turn on during specific hours is also a good strategy.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Minimize Notifications to Only Essential Ones</h2>
                <p>Turn off notifications from non-work-related apps (social media, shopping, games, etc.). Every notification can break your concentration, and it takes more time than you think to regain focus. Keep only essential work-related notifications on.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Resist the Temptation of 'Multitasking'</h2>
                <p>While it might seem efficient to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, it actually disperses your concentration and lowers productivity. Focus on one task at a time, and take short breaks when switching between tasks.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Organize Your 'Digital Workspace'</h2>
                <p>Keep your computer desktop tidy and organize unnecessary files or folders. Maintain a minimal number of browser tabs and close websites unrelated to your work to help maintain focus.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Apply the 'Pomodoro Technique'</h2>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break, is effective for managing digital device usage efficiently and boosting concentration. Use a timer app to take regular breaks and maintain your focus.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Take 'Digital Breaks'</h2>
                <p>If you've been using digital devices for a long time, rest your eyes by closing them or looking into the distance. Short stretches or walks are also good. You need time to completely disconnect from digital devices and let your brain rest.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>7. Reduce Digital Device Use During 'Off-Work Hours'</h2>
                <p>Minimize the use of work-related digital devices after work or on weekends. Clearly separate your work and personal life, and get enough rest to gain energy for your next work session.</p>
