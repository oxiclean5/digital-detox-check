            <p>Digital devices can boost our work efficiency, but they are also the biggest obstacles to concentration. Here are some smart digital habits to maximize your focus at work.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>1. Actively use "Do Not Disturb" mode</h2>
                <p>During times when you need to focus on work, turn on your smartphone's "Do Not Disturb" mode. Block all notifications and set it so that only important contacts can reach you. Scheduling this mode for specific times is also effective.</p>

                <h2>2. Minimize notifications, keep only what you need</h2>
                <p>Turn off notifications for all non-work apps (social media, shopping, games, etc.). Every notification breaks your focus, and it takes longer than you think to regain it. Keep only essential work notifications.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Escape the temptation of "multitasking"</h2>
                <p>It may seem efficient to handle multiple tasks at once, but in reality, it scatters your focus and lowers productivity. Focus on one task at a time, and take short breaks when switching tasks.</p>

                <h2>4. Organize your "digital workspace"</h2>
                <p>Keep your computer desktop tidy and organize unnecessary files and folders. Minimize browser tabs and close unrelated sites to help maintain focus.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Use the "Pomodoro Technique"</h2>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique—25 minutes of focus followed by 5 minutes of rest—helps you manage your digital device usage efficiently and maintain concentration. Use a timer app and take regular breaks to stay focused.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Take "digital breaks"</h2>
                <p>After long periods of digital device use, close your eyes or look into the distance to relieve eye strain. Short stretches or walks are also recommended. It's important to completely step away from digital devices and relax your body.</p>

                <h2>7. Reduce digital device use outside of work</h2>
                <p>After work and on weekends, minimize your use of work-related digital devices. Clearly separate work and personal life, and take enough rest to recharge for your next tasks.</p>
