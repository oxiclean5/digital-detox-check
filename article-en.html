                <h2>1. Are you also in a "digital dependency" state?</h2>
                <p>Do you reach for your smartphone as soon as you wake up? If you can't put it down even while eating or right before bed, your hand might be glued to your phone. In the flood of information, we may be experiencing "digital dependency" without even realizing it.</p>

                <h2>2. What is "Digital Detox"?</h2>
                <p>Digital detox is, as the name suggests, the process of removing the "toxins" of the digital world. It means intentionally distancing yourself from smartphones, computers, and social media for a while to refresh your mind and body. It's not about complete disconnection, but about regaining a healthy balance.</p>

                <h2>3. Positive changes you can feel</h2>
                <p>Digital detox brings us more positive effects than we expect.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stress OUT, Calmness IN:</strong> Escaping from constant notifications and information overload naturally calms your mind and reduces stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>No more sleepless nights:</strong> The blue light from your phone is a main culprit for poor sleep! Detoxing is one of the easiest ways to get better rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconnect with the "real" world:</strong> Instead of staring at your phone, look at the faces of people around you. The precious relationships and joy you forgot are waiting for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regain lost focus and creativity:</strong> Cutting off mindless phone use boosts your work or study efficiency and helps new ideas come to you naturally.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Start a "gentle detox life" today</h2>
                <p>No need to overthink it. Start with very small practices recommended by experts.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Separate spaces:</strong> Designate your bedroom or dining table as a "phone-free zone" and keep your phone away physically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate times:</strong> Use "Do Not Disturb" mode for specific times like "one hour before bed" or "morning work hours" to ensure phone-free periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn off notifications:</strong> Boldly turn off notifications for shopping, games, and social media apps that you don't need to check right away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan alternative activities:</strong> Decide in advance what you'll do with the time you gain by putting down your phone (e.g., a 10-minute walk, reading 5 pages of a book, stretching, etc.).</li>
                </ol>
