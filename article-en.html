                <h2>2. What is 'Digital Detox'?</h2>
                <p>Digital detox, as the name suggests, is the process of removing the 'toxins' of the digital world. It means intentionally taking a break from smartphones, computers, and social media to recharge your tired mind and body. It's not about complete disconnection, but rather about finding a healthy balance.</p>

                <h2>3. The Amazing Changes a Pause Can Bring</h2>
                <p>Digital detox can bring about surprisingly positive effects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stress OUT, Calm IN:</strong> When you step away from constant notifications and information overload, your brain finally gets to rest. A clearer mind and reduced stress are natural outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>No More Sleepless Nights:</strong> The blue light from smartphones is a major culprit for disturbed sleep! Detox is one of the easiest ways to get a good night's sleep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconnect with the 'Real' World:</strong> Instead of a smartphone screen, look at the faces of people around you. Precious relationships and forgotten joys are waiting for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rediscover Focus and Creativity:</strong> By eliminating distractions, your efficiency in work or study will improve, and you'll have the mental space for new, creative ideas to emerge.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Starting Your 'Wise Detox Life' Today</h2>
                <p>You don't need grand gestures. Start with small, actionable steps recommended by experts.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Separate Spaces:</strong> Designate your bedroom and dining table as 'smartphone-free zones' and physically keep your devices away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate Time:</strong> Use 'Do Not Disturb' mode during specific times like '1 hour before bedtime' or 'morning work hours' to ensure uninterrupted time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn Off Notifications:</strong> Boldly turn off notifications from non-essential apps like shopping, games, and social media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find Alternative Activities:</strong> Plan specific enjoyable activities to do instead of using your smartphone (e.g., a 10-minute walk, reading 5 pages of a book, stretching).</li>
                </ol>
